          <h2>Churrasco - Barbecue</h2>
          <p>If you enjoy eating meat you must go to a Churrascaria! There is lots of food including many types of meat, a salad bar, traditional snacks such as pastel and p√£o de queijo and sometimes even pasta, Japanese food or pizza.</p>
          <p>These restaurants are rodizios, which means waiters will pass on your table with the meats. Expect a lot of different cuts of beef, chicken and pork. You can choose which part of the meat you want just pointing to the waiter.</p>
          <p>The price includes all you can eat, but does not include drinks and desserts.</p>
